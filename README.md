### Project Description

This project aimed to create an application where a user is provided feedback pertaining to whether
they uploaded a resume or cover letter, as well as what kind of job they want to use their resume or cover letter for when applying

### Additional Information

This project utilized several different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to provide the appropriate feedback to the user.
The first technique that was used was the Question Answering model (the t-5 base model from the HuggingFace library).
The Question Answering model used the following 4 questions to generate answers 
specific to the content of the user's resume or cover letter:
  -What kinds of skills are being described?
  -What kinds of projects were worked on?
  -What kinds of technologies were used?
  -In what ways were the the technologies described used?
Additionally, ROUGE was used to compare the answers the employers may want to see in response to the questions
above to the answers that were generated by the Question Answering model. All of the words that overlapped between
the expected answers and the generated answers would be taken into account when providing feedback on what
the user did well. On the other hand, all of the words that were present in the expected answers but
not the generated answers would be taken into account when providing feedback on things the user may consider to add
to their resume or cover letter. It's important to note that the user would only be provided feedback on ways to improve
if the ROUGE 1 score was below 70% accuracy.
Finally, Context Free Grammars were used to specify the rules of grammar a sentence must abide to. This is helpful in
facilitating feedback to the user on which in their cover letter are not grammatically correct and need to be revised.
It's important to note that the Context Frree Grammars are dynamic, as they change whenever a new word and part of speech
get encountered. In essence, it's creation is meant to be scalable, without having to manually add thousands of
words and part of speech tags when processing myriads of cover letters.
